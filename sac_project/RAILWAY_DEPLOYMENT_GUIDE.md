# Railway Deployment Guide for SAC Website

## ðŸš€ Complete Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app with GitHub)
- Your code pushed to GitHub repository

---

## Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

If you haven't already pushed your code:

```bash
cd /Users/ankitagarwal546/Desktop/FULL_STACK_COLLEGE_CLUB_EVENT_WEBSITE/sac_project

# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"

# Add your GitHub repository (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/ankitagarwal546/FULL_STACK_COLLEGE_CLUB_EVENT_WEBSITE.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 2: Create Railway Project

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"Start a New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub
5. Select your repository: `FULL_STACK_COLLEGE_CLUB_EVENT_WEBSITE`
6. Railway will automatically detect it's a Django project

---

## Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"**
3. Choose **"PostgreSQL"**
4. Railway will automatically create a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

---

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

In Railway project settings, go to **"Variables"** tab and add:

### Required Variables:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

### How to generate SECRET_KEY:
Run this command locally:
```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

**Note:** `DATABASE_URL` is automatically set by Railway when you add PostgreSQL.

---

## Step 5: Deploy!

1. Railway will automatically deploy after you add the database
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. Click on your deployment to see the public URL
4. Your website will be live at: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

---

## Step 6: Create Admin User (Important!)

After first deployment, you need to create an admin user:

1. In Railway, go to your **project**
2. Click on the **service** (your Django app)
3. Go to **"Settings"** â†’ **"Deploys"**
4. Find the latest deploy and click the **three dots** â†’ **"View Logs"**
5. On the top right, click **"+ New Tab"** (terminal icon)
6. This opens a terminal in your Railway container

Run these commands in the Railway terminal:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create your admin account.

---

## Step 7: Update ALLOWED_HOSTS

After Railway gives you your public domain:

1. Copy your Railway domain (e.g., `your-app-name.up.railway.app`)
2. Update the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment variable in Railway:
   ```
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app-name.up.railway.app
   ```
3. Railway will automatically redeploy

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "DisallowedHost" error
**Solution:** Add your Railway domain to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment variable

### Issue: Static files not loading
**Solution:** Railway should run `collectstatic` automatically. Check deployment logs.
