# âœ… Railway Deployment Setup Complete!

## What Was Done:

### 1. Created Deployment Files âœ…
- **Procfile** - Tells Railway how to run your Django app with Gunicorn
- **runtime.txt** - Specifies Python 3.13.7
- **railway.json** - Railway-specific configuration with automatic migrations
- **nixpacks.toml** - Build configuration for Railway
- **.env** - Local development environment variables
- **.env.example** - Template for others to set up environment

### 2. Updated Existing Files âœ…
- **requirements.txt** - Added production dependencies:
  - gunicorn (production web server)
  - whitenoise (static file serving)
  - psycopg2-binary (PostgreSQL driver)
  - dj-database-url (database configuration)
  - python-dotenv (environment variable management)

- **settings.py** - Made production-ready:
  - Automatic database switching (SQLite locally, PostgreSQL on Railway)
  - Environment variable support for SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS
  - WhiteNoise for static files
  - Security settings for production
  - Railway domain auto-detection

### 3. Installation Verified âœ…
- All dependencies installed in your virtual environment
- Django configuration validated successfully
- Local development still works normally

---

## ðŸ“‹ Your Next Steps:

### Step 1: Generate a Secret Key
Run this command to generate a secure SECRET_KEY for production:

```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Save this key - you'll need it in Railway!

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd /Users/ankitagarwal546/Desktop/FULL_STACK_COLLEGE_CLUB_EVENT_WEBSITE/sac_project

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Railway

1. **Go to https://railway.app**
2. **Sign in with your GitHub account**
3. **Click "Start a New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your repository: FULL_STACK_COLLEGE_CLUB_EVENT_WEBSITE**

### Step 4: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"**
3. Choose **"PostgreSQL"**
4. Railway will automatically create a `DATABASE_URL` variable

### Step 5: Set Environment Variables

In Railway, go to your Django service â†’ **"Variables"** tab and add:

```
SECRET_KEY=<paste-the-key-you-generated-in-step-1>
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=<your-railway-domain>.up.railway.app
```

**Note:** Replace `<your-railway-domain>` with the actual domain Railway gives you (you'll see it after first deployment).

### Step 6: Wait for Deployment

Railway will automatically:
- Install Python 3.13.7
- Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
- Run database migrations
- Collect static files
- Start your app with Gunicorn

This takes about 2-3 minutes.

### Step 7: Create Admin User

After deployment succeeds:

1. In Railway, click on your Django service
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down and click **"Create Shell"** or use the terminal icon
4. In the terminal, run:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create your admin account.

### Step 8: Access Your Website! ðŸŽ‰

- **Main site:** https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
- **Admin panel:** https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/admin

---

## ðŸ”„ Updating Your Website

Whenever you make changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your change description"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically detect the push and redeploy! âœ¨

## ðŸ’° Railway Costs

- **Free tier:** $5 credit per month
- **Your usage:** Approximately $3-5/month for a small Django site
- **No credit card** required to start
- Monitor usage in the Railway dashboard

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "DisallowedHost" error
**Fix:** Update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in Railway variables to include your Railway domain

### Issue: Static files not showing
**Fix:** Railway runs `collectstatic` automatically. Check deployment logs.

### Issue: Database not working
**Fix:** Ensure PostgreSQL database is added and connected

### Issue: Can't login to admin
**Fix:** Make sure you created a superuser (Step 7)
