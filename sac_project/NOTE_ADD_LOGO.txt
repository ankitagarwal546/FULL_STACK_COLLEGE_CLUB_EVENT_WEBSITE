⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add SAC Logo to Project
=========================================

The base template references a logo file at:
static/images/sac.png

You need to add your SAC logo to this location:
/Users/ankitagarwal546/Desktop/frontend/COLLEGE-CLUB-WEBSITE/sac_project/static/images/sac.png

If you have the logo file (sac.png) in the root directory, copy it to static/images/:

```bash
cp sac.png sac_project/static/images/
```

Or if you're in the sac_project directory:
```bash
cp ../sac.png static/images/
```

After adding the logo, the navbar will display it correctly.

If you don't have a sac.png file, you can:
1. Create/download a logo for SAC-IIIT Naya Raipur
2. Save it as sac.png
3. Copy it to static/images/ directory
